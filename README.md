# Advent of code 2023
Some solutions to [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Initially I set out to get some experience with Go, which I had previously never used. I was impressed by how easy the language was to pick up, although I don't currently see a place for it in my usual workflows. I am still interested in exploring Go alongside HTMX to build front-ends in the future, but for the time being I have switched back to Rust for the remainder of AoC.
